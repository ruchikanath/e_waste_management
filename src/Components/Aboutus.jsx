          Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for carrying out R&D in IT, Electronics, and associated areas. Different areas of C-DAC originated at various times, many of which came out as a result of identifying opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The establishment of C-DAC in 1988 itself aimed to build Supercomputers in response to the denial of import of Supercomputers by the USA. Since then, C-DAC has been building multiple generations of Supercomputers starting from PARAM with 1 GF in 1988.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost at the same time, C-DAC began building Indian Language Computing Solutions with the establishment of the GIST group (Graphics and Intelligence-based Script Technology). National Centre for Software Technology (NCST), set up in 1985, also initiated work in Indian Language Computing around the same period.
